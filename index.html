      <h2>Context and Goals</h2>
      <p>
        
        Nuclei are quantum systems with a rich internal structure characterized by motion, interaction, and response to external probes. The structure extends over multiple scales, from the size of the nuclear bound state (~ several fm) to the hadronic scale of nucleons and mesons (~ 1 fm) to the quark/gluon substructure governed by Quantum Chromodynamics (<< 1 fm).
        The future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) will enable a program of high-energy electron scattering experiments on light nuclei (A = 2, 3, 4...), extending the reach of earlier fixed-target scattering experiments at Jefferson Lab and other facilities. Such experiments can answer basic questions such as the chromodynamic origin of the nucleon-nucleon interactions, the presence of non-nucleonic degrees of freedom in nuclei, the effect of nuclear binding on the quarks and gluons in nuclei, and the spatial distributions of chromodynamic matter in nuclei. The results could transform our efforts to understand nuclear structure and processes from first principles.
        Scattering processes on nuclei at multi-GeV energies require specific theoretical and experimental methods for measurement and analysis. Theory needs to describe the configurations in the nucleus in initial state, the impact of scattering process on the composite system, and the distribution of particles in the final state. A special feature of high-energy scattering on nuclei is that the processes involve structures at multiple energy and time/distance scales, requiring appropriate techniques. Experiments at EIC need to prepare the ion beam, possibly including polarization, and detect the nuclear fragments in the final state.
        The goal is to enable students to join current research efforts in this area and participate in the development of the EIC light-ion physics program. This also brings the opportunities for more collaboration between many different groups in nuclear physics.
